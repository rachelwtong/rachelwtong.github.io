## Portfolio

I started my self-guided data science journey in 2022 with a focus on developing the technical skills required to directly manipulate and analyze data. The data projects within this portfolio demonstrate my learning in the following topics: 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (Python/Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Machine Learning Modeling (Scikit-Learn)
- Statistical Testing (Scipy)

### Project Spotlights

[Spotify Library of Data Analysis](../html/Spotify Library of Music Analysis.html)
<img src="images/Spotify Analysis.png?raw=true"/>
This project was completed as the final assignment for NYU's Data Bootcamp course taken in 2021 and serves as my initial foray into the world of data science. In this project, a dataset of Spotify tracks containing data pulled using the Spotify Web API is used to analyze trends in music over time. The project contains three parts: <br>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Song Recommender (Distance Matrix)
3. Song Popularity Predictor (ML Models)

[Rachel's Spotify Data Analysis](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

Building off of the Spotify Library of Data Analysis, I conducted an exploratory analysis of my own streaming data that all users can request from Spotify. In this project, I use my own streaming data from the last year as well as the Spotify tracks dataset pulled using the Spotify Web API to also add song audio characteristics to my analysis. As a next step, I hope to further refine this project by creating a Rachel's preference predicting model that can be combined with the Song Recommender from the previous Spotify analysis to tailor the recommender to my own preference.

[Datacamp Competition: Predicting Hotel Cancellations](http://example.com/)

(/https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/predict-hotel-cancellation)
This project was completed as a part of a DataCamp Competition to support a hotel's desire to understand reasons for and predict hotel cancellations. During this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis of the dataset, used Information Value and Weight of Evidence to support my feature selection, visualized impact of different features, and built a logistics regression model to predict cancellations.
