## Data Science Portfolio

I started my self-guided data science journey in 2022 with a focus on developing the technical skills required to directly manipulate and analyze data. The data projects within this portfolio demonstrate my learning in the following topics: 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (Python/Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Machine Learning Modeling (Scikit-Learn)
- Statistical Testing (Scipy)

## Project Spotlights

### [Spotify Library of Music Analysis](../html/Spotify Library of Music Analysis.html)
<img src="images/Spotify Analysis.png?raw=true"/>
This project analyzes trends in music over time, based on a dataset of Spotify tracks pulled using the Spotify Web API. The project contains three parts: <br>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Song Recommender (Distance Matrix)
3. Song Popularity Predictor (ML Models)

Building upon my love for music and the Spotify Library of Music Analysis, I conducted an exploratory analysis of my own streaming data that all users can request from Spotify. In this project, I use my own streaming data from last year as well as the Spotify tracks dataset pulled using the Spotify Web API to add song audio characteristics to my analysis. As a next step, I hope to further refine this project by creating a 'Rachel's Preference' predictive model that can be combined with the Song Recommender from the previous Spotify project to tailor the recommender to my own preference.

### [Datacamp Competition: Predicting Hotel Cancellations](../html/Predicting Hotel Cancellations.html)
<img src="images/Hotel Cancellations.png?raw=true"/>
This project was completed as a part of a DataCamp Competition to support a hotel's desire to understand and predict hotel cancellations. During this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis of the dataset, used Information Value and Weight of Evidence to support my feature selection, visualized the impact of different features, and built a logistics regression model to predict cancellations.
